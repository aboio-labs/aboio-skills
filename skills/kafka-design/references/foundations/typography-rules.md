## Typography Rules

### Line Length

Optimal reading comfort by context:

| Context          | Characters/Line | Notes                   |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Body text        | 50-75 (ideal: 65)| Comfortable reading    |
| Dense interfaces | Up to 90        | Acceptable in tables    |
| Forms            | 40-50           | Easy scanning           |

### Sentence Case

Use sentence case for all UI elements:
- **Correct:** "Save product", "Recent orders", "Create new"
- **Incorrect:** "Save Product", "RECENT ORDERS", "CREATE NEW"

**Exception:** Abbreviations remain uppercase (ISBN, NF-e, BISAC, ONIX).

### Brand Voice in UI

**Do:**
- Use publishing terminology correctly (ISBN, ONIX, BISAC, consignment)
- Write concise, scannable interface copy
- Lead with action verbs (Create, Review, Approve, Settle)
- Provide context without over-explaining

**Don't:**
- Use generic tech jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm")
- Write marketing fluff in the interface
- Explain basic publishing concepts to professionals
- Use emojis in professional contexts

### Vertical Rhythm for Text

- **Heading to body:** 12px (space-3)
- **Body to heading:** 24px (space-6)
- **Paragraph spacing:** 16px (space-4)

See `patterns/vertical-rhythm.md` for full spacing rules.
